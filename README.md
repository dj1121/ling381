## Written English for Nonnative Speakers
{:.no_toc}

**Instructor: Devin Johnson (devinjohnson2026@u.northwestern.edu)**<br>

**Office Hours: By Email Appointment**

One of the most important communication skills necessary for a successful academic career – and many other careers – is the ability to write effectively. 
This course addresses the needs of nonnative speakers of English in developing their writing skills, and we focus on the mechanics of English sentences as well as the local
and global discourse structure of written texts. I encourage a workshop atmosphere where student work is reviewed and discussed by the class. 
I also provide direct feedback on regular writing assignments. The assignments encourage you to focus on your skills as you write about your research and personal interests.

from me and other students. Your grade will be based upon completion of weekly writing assignments and active participation.

Our weekly meetings will have roughly the following structure:
1. Freewrite warmup

Weekly homework is split into three parts:

### Accessibility
Northwestern University is committed to providing the most accessible learning environment as possible for students with disabilities. Should you anticipate or experience disability-related barriers in the academic setting, please contact AccessibleNU to move forward with the university’s established accommodation process (e: accessiblenu@northwestern.edu; p: 847-467-5530). If you already have established accommodations with AccessibleNU, please let me know as soon as possible, preferably within the first two weeks of the term, so we can work together to implement your disability accommodations. Disability information, including academic accommodations, is confidential under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

### Religious Observances
Northwestern is committed to fostering an academic community respectful and welcoming of persons from all backgrounds.  To that end, the policy on academic accommodations for religious holidays stipulates that students will not be penalized for class absences to observe religious holidays. If you will observe a religious holiday during a class meeting, scheduled exam, or assignment deadline, please let me know as soon as possible, preferably within the first two week of class. If exams or assignment deadlines on the syllabus fall on religious holidays you observe, please reach out so that we can discuss that coursework.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Instructors are encouraged to consider including a statement about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in their course syllabi. By including a DEI statement, instructors can help establish a welcoming tone and demonstrate what they value in the learning environment. For more information and examples, go to the Searle Center for Advancing Learning and Teaching’s resources on creating inclusive learning environments.

### Course Details Subject to Change
Please note that the specifics of this course syllabus are subject to change in the case of unforeseen circumstances. Instructors will notify students of any changes as soon as possible. Students will be responsible for abiding by the changes.

### Prohibition of Recording
Unauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities (including advising sessions or office hours) is prohibited. Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact AccessibleNU. Unauthorized use of classroom recordings – including distributing or posting them – is also prohibited. Under the University’s Copyright Policy, faculty own the copyright to instructional materials – including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations. Students cannot copy, reproduce, display, or distribute these materials. Students who engage in unauthorized recording, unauthorized use of a recording, or unauthorized distribution of instructional materials will be referred to the appropriate University office for follow-up.
