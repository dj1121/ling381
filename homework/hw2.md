# Homework 2

## Weekly Journal (Optional)
You can write anything you want and ask me questions here. I will give corrections for 
what you write. This is an oppprtunity to practice things you want to practice.

## Discussion Post
Explain your research in five different levels. For examples, take a look on Youtube
at videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkIvmfqX-t0). The levels you should explain at are:

1. Child
2. Teenager
3. College student (in any field)
4. Graduate student (in any field)
5. Expert in your field


## Writing Assignment
In this assignment, the idea is to understand how researchers in your field **persuade** with their writing.
In other words, we want to know what sort of language makes the readers in your field want to keep reading.

First, collect two influential papers from your field and one of your pieces of writing:

1. Briefly tell me what the paper is about.
2. Show three examples of places in the paper where you think the author is telling the reader why they should read. If possible, I recommend printing the paper and highlighting.
3. Show five words that you think the author uses to signal, "This is important!". If possible, I recommend printing the paper and highlighting.

Then, answer the following:

4. Compare and contrast your writing to the papers in your field. How are they similar/different?
5. What can you do in your next paper to be more persuasive? (give specific examples)
