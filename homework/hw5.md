# Homework 5

## Weekly Journal (Optional)
You can write anything you want and ask me questions here. I will give corrections for 
what you write. This is an oppprtunity to practice things you want to practice.

## Discussion Post
Consider a question from your field and a hypothesis related to it. This could be
the same hypothesis you wrote about last week, if you want. Now, consider how you would
fit the problem, hypothesis, experiment, etc. into the following structure:

1. Introduction
2. Literature Review
3. Methodology
4. Results
5. Discussion
6. Conclusion

Please make a post and fill in each section (1-6) with what information you think would be relevant using bullet points.
For example, you might want to fill in the introduction with some notes about the research problem and other things you think are
important. Always remember that each section has a **purpose**, so you want to make sure it is clear to us readers what that purpose 
is and how everything fits together.

## Writing Assignment
Pick a section of a paper that you have written in the past (intro, literature, etc.). Then, review your writing according to
the criteria we discussed in class (refer to slides posted on canvas). How well do you think you met the goals for the section you picked? 

For example, if you picked an intro, you should try to find the following elements: 1) the problem, 2) why the problem is important, 3)
the solution/hypothesis/etc.
