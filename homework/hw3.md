# Homework 3

## Weekly Journal (Optional)
You can write anything you want and ask me questions here. I will give corrections for 
what you write. This is an oppprtunity to practice things you want to practice.

## Discussion Post
This week, I'd like you to select an interesting [opinion article](https://dailynorthwestern.com/opinion/) from the Daily Northwestern and
do the following:

1. Briefly summarize the writerâ€™s argument in 2-3 sentences. (Find the most important points)
2. Gently point out a problem in their argument.
3. Propose a solution to that problem.
4. Defend your solution with 2-3 sentences. 

Keep the following points in mind to guide your writing:
- Remember to think about your audience (us) and why we should care! 
- Never use more words than you need to; we want the biggest effect for the smallest amount of words.
- Make sure the argument is clear and that each defense you make is relevant to it.

## Writing Assignment
This week, I'm keeping it kind of simple:

1. Think of a process that requires at least 5 steps to reach a goal. 
2. Describe the process using an introduction (why do it), body (how to do it), and conclusion (what your writing did to help the reader).

Notes:
- **Do not** describe the process using bullet points.
- Think about how to join the steps using transitions from one step to the next.
- Feel free to be creative in the process you describe, but always remember the reader!
