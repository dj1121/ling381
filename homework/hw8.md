# Homework 8

## Weekly Journal (Optional)
You can write anything you want and ask me questions here. I will give corrections for 
what you write. This is an oppprtunity to practice things you want to practice.

## Discussion Post
None - we will talk in class.

## Writing Assignment
Prepare a piece of writing that you want to bring to class. For example, if you have a paper that
you need to submit for a class, you can submit part of it to me and also bring it to class. In class,
we will give each other feedback.
