# Homework 6

## Weekly Journal (Optional)
You can write anything you want and ask me questions here. I will give corrections for 
what you write. This is an oppprtunity to practice things you want to practice.

## Discussion Post
What aspects of your writing do you think sound unnatural/non-native? Make at least three example sentences
where you are not sure what sounds most natural. I will comment on your sentences and discuss what choices you could
make to improve their naturalness.

## Writing Assignment
Take a look at the exercises [here](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/english-for-uni/ua/media/84/articles-exercises-english-for-uni.pdf). Try to
do them yourself before looking at the answers. Ask me at least one question about the usage of a(n)/the in these exercises.
For example, is there an example where you don't understand which option (a/the/nothing) to choose?
