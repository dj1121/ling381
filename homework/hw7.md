# Homework 7

## Weekly Journal (Optional)
You can write anything you want and ask me questions here. I will give corrections for 
what you write. This is an oppprtunity to practice things you want to practice.

## Discussion Post
First, have a watch of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1U26PLiXjM). 
Now, your job is to pretend that you are Uri Alon and submit an abstract for your talk to the organizers of TED. 
Please limit your abstract to 150 words.

## Writing Assignment
Go back to the discussion of HW2 and take the text describing your research.
Now, your task is to turn it into a tweet. This means you can only use a **max of 280 characters** (not words).
This will require you to really think hard about the real essentials of your research. Imagine that this tweet
will be for a general audience and its purpose is to show the importance of your research. 
You can use [this site](https://wordcounter.net/character-count) to check your character count.
